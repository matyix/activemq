This is slighly adapted from:
http://pookey.co.uk/wordpress/archives/74-playing-with-activemq-using-maven

To use:

0. Install Java and Maven
1. Open three shell windows (or tabs)
2. In one of those shells, go to the mq directory
3. Exeucte the shell script: start_queue.sh
4. In a second shell, go to the directory consumer
5. Execute the shell script: consume.sh
6. In the the third shell, go to the directory producer
7. Execute the shell script: produce.sh

You can continue to execute produce.sh. When you want to stop the madness,
you can hit ^c in consumer and mq shells.

Alternatively, you can try using end.sh in the producer directory.
